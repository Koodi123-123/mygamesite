      <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        You must click numbers from 1 to N in order as fast as possible.<br/>
        The grid size starts with 25 numbers randomly placed.<br/>
        If you complete clicking all numbers within 60 seconds, you advance to the next level.<br/>
        Each next level increases the grid size by 5 numbers, making the game harder.<br/>
        If you fail to complete the level within time, the game ends and you can retry the current level.<br/>
        Your score depends on correct clicks (+10 points each) and wrong clicks (-5 points each).<br/>
        Your best time and score per level is saved and shown after each game.<br/>
        The numbers that you haven't clicked yet move randomly every 6 seconds, increasing the challenge.
